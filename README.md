# Connecto Discord Bot

Connecto is a Discord bot that creates "speed-dates" to help community members get to know each other in a fun and exciting way. It works with *slash commands*.

## How It Works

1. **Lobby** - Community managers can create a lobby where they can choose who has permission to speak and also add music for vibes by providing a Spotify or YouTube link (think of it as a Twitter space).

2. **Dates** - The community manager can create a speed date by specifying the duration and number of participants (default is 2 members and a 5-minute meeting). When the meeting starts, the participants will be automatically paired into voice channels. After the meeting, Connecto will bring the members back to the Lobby.

Community members can create as many dates as they would like.
